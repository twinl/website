[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/110261678.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/110261678)

This repository contains the website code of the project
[TwiNL](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/twinl) 
(2012-2013) of the Netherlands eScience Center. Apart 
from the website, the project also produced a
[Twitter crawler](https://github.com/twinl/crawler).

The main tweet search script in this repository is 
`cgi-bin/twitter`. It collects a search query from
a user, starts the search process, collects the results and
displays them as a collection of web pages.

The contact person for this project is Erik Tjong Kim Sang.
